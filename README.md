# Bias-and-Variance-Trade-off
Implementation

All Models tends to make some error, there is no model which can make perfect predictions, then can we control these errors which models makes, 
to understand this, we need to understand the compositions which models makes. Prediction error could be decomposed into two components, called 
as Error due to Bias & Error due to Variance.No model can minimize both Bias and Variance. Hence, there is a tradeoff between Bias and Variance. 
By keeping track of these results means keep diagnosing model results, and it should not lead to underfitting/Overfitting condition.
